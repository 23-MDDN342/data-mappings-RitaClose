I am not a fan so far. Object Oriented coding is difficult and I don't entirely understand it. So far I have imported my characters face into the new code framework but the variables aren't working right so far so I need to tinker a bit to make them better. Also I need to re-orient all of the measurements so that they follow the faces from the AI instead of keeping the same all the time.
